# Titanic-Kaggle-Competition
#### This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

#### The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## First Submission
### After cleaning the data i uese a sklearn.linear_model and imported LogisticRegression.
### As you will see in my coding i got accuracy score of 76%.

## Second Submission
### I tried a diffrent moudle to enhance my accuracy score.
### I build what's known as a random forest model. This model is constructed of several "trees" (there are three trees in the picture below, but we'll construct 100!) that will individually consider each passenger's data and vote on whether the individual survived. Then, the random forest model makes a democratic decision: the outcome with the most votes wins!

### And i had accuracy score of 78% and that made me in the top 16% of the leaderboard i will try to enhance my score with other modules later on.
